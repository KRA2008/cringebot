# cringebot

Cringebot explores the tendency many human brains have to cause themselves discomfort by involuntarily recalling negative memories. 

I hope that by making users of the app aware of the tendencies they have for this behavior, they will be more empowered to accept themselves and live happier lives.

Cringebot helps you to see that you are the Cringebot.

Cringebot can do a couple things:
* Track occurrences of involuntary recall/intrusive memories in real time
* Simulate involuntary recall/intrusive memories from a user-generated list of memories
    
By tracking occurrences, Cringebot helps you to be more aware of how much these occurrences affect your daily life. By simulating, Cringebot helps you to realize the absurdity of the phenomenon and perhaps build up a psychological tolerance. Simulation could also be used by people who don't experience such things so they can better understand people who do.

(I am not a doctor. Cringebot is not therapy.)
